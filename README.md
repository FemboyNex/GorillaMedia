# 🎧 GorillaMedia
GorillaMedia is a mod for **Gorilla Tag** that lets you see and control any media that is playing on your computer. This mod supports any media that can show through the Windows Media API, including Spotify, VLC Media Player, YouTube Music, and iTunes.

## How does it work?
Powered with the **[QuickSong](https://github.com/iiDk-the-actual/QuickSong) library**, it retrieves the currently playing song's icon, name, artist, and elapsed time, and shows it on a simple UI that you can see by looking at your left wrist.
To pause music or skip tracks, you can simply click the buttons with your finger.
